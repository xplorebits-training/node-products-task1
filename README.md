# Task Description

Your task is to create a CLI program that allows users to manage a list of products. The program should have the following features:

* Display a list of all products.
* Add a new product to the list.
* Edit an existing product in the list.
* Delete an existing product from the list.
* Filter the list of products based on the category.

## Requirements
* Use Node.js to build the CLI program.
* Use an array of objects to store the products. Each product object should have the following properties: name, price, category.
* Use the readline module to prompt the user for input.
* Use the console.table package to display the list of products.
* Use the map and filter array methods to manipulate the products array.

## Bonus Points
* Implement error handling to prevent the user from entering invalid input.
* Use the chalk package to add color to the output.
* Use the yargs package to parse command-line arguments and options.
* Use a validation library such as Joi or Validator.js to validate the input from the user.

## Submission Guidelines
* Submit the code this GitHub repository.
* Update the README.md file that explains how to run the program and any additional instructions.

## Evaluation Criteria
* Correctness: Does the CLI program meet the requirements and work as expected?
* Code Quality: Is the code well-structured and easy to understand?
* User Interface: Is the user interface intuitive and easy to use?
* Bonus Points: Did the intern implement any of the bonus features? If so, how well were they implemented?
